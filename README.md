# Tic Tac Toe Game
## The Tic Tac Toe game is a simple, two-player game where players take turns marking a square on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game. If all squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
